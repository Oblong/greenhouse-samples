Welcome to Greenhouse!
======================

      You are standing in an open field west of a green house, with a boarded front door.
      There is a small mailbox here.


This repo contains sample applications written using Oblong's Greenhouse SDK. Greenhouse is a toolkit for creative coders; it is free for non-commercial and limited-scale use.

Greenhouse is a minimalist version of Oblong's g-speak SDK. (g-speak is what we at Oblong use to build all our spatially-aware, multi-user, multi-platform, multi-device software.) We've taken the core parts of g-speak and distilled them into a C++ SDK whose goal is to be approachable, powerful, and concise.

Greenhouse includes our own custom Kinect-processing pipeline, and hooks for working with Leap Motion, Wiimotes, mobile device input, etc.

The Greenhouse SDK can be downloaded here:  [greenhouse.oblong.com](http://greenhouse.oblong.com/)
